# Library-SQL-Database
This is a school project where I paired with some colleagues to develop a library database using PostgreSQL in pgAdmin4, creating a populated DataBase with a library model as it used to be "BlockBuster", including clients and employees name, id, number, books names and ids, publishers, movies, videogames, and rentals for all of them, including a table where we added the initial rental and the time left or deadline for the rental, that was related to the clients ID, among other features the library db has.
This repo contains my and my teams SQL file named as "Library DB SQL" and the professional documentation file named "Final Project Library Database" that includes our process in the making for the project, including the diagrams used such as ER/EER and normalized ER/EER diagrams, the Relational Database Schema, the Database normalization and the data dictionary for all of our tables.
I really enjoyed creating this Database and this project can showcase some abilities for building relational databases and proper documentation paired with team work.
